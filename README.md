- 👋 Hi, I’m @elpipos22
- 👀 I’m interested in utilitar use of programing with minimal effort (max value/effort ratio)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use linux (Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS) and to write some rudementary code in Python along with Git usage to let me automatize some tasks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automatic guitar advisor (scrypt that would help make music and potentialy tutor on how to play guitar)... as im trying to make it in Python & command line, but it'd be likely nicer with some GUI.
- 📫 How to reach me - try pinging me using Email - kartaginaball@gmail.com
